In order to be suitable for usage by Wix, library has been modified:
  * Naming was changed to reflect new purpose of the project (wix-related, no longer demo)
  * README.md re-written
  * Code formatting
  * Changed S3Uploader to S3Utils to make it more generic and add additional functionality
  * Removed/changed code comments which are no longer suitable after code changes
  * Changed URL query param names to have them more generic
  * Output file name/path was made configurable, path was simplified, bucket renamed
  * Removed Lambda function - only task is needed
